<!--
This script uses these variables:

2. {previous_generated_bangla} - The Bengali translation that may need correction
-->

## Arabic Hadith:

{{hadis_arabic_text}}

## Bengali Translation:

{{previous_generated_bangla}}


## Instruction: 
- You should Keep the Bangla Translation Unchanged. 
- Split long paragraphs, those exceeds 450–550 words or 8–10 sentences.
- Split at natural logical breaks such as topic shifts, new examples, or transitions.
- Format vertically only lists with explicit markers (e.g., (1)) or clearly distinct multi-item sequences (ignore simple inline 'A, B, C'). Precede these vertical formats with a paragraph break. Change marks to (১), (২),  (৩); use • for unmarked items made vertical. Preserve exact text/meaning.
- **STRICTLY, Don't change any other thing except upper instructions**


<!-- ## Instruction: 
- You should Keep the Bangla Translation Unchanged.
- Prioritize splitting overly long paragraphs, particularly those exceeding approximately 450–550 words or 8–10 sentences.
- Split at natural logical breaks such as topic shifts, new examples, or transitions.
- For moderately long paragraphs, perform a split only if:  logical break is evident, and it improves clarity.
- Keep the original content, make sure the flow stays smooth and coherent after splitting.
- Format vertically only lists with explicit markers (e.g., (1)) or clearly distinct multi-item sequences (ignore simple inline 'A, B, C'). Precede these vertical formats with a paragraph break. Change marks to (১), (২),  (৩); use • for unmarked items made vertical. Preserve exact text/meaning.

## Output:

Return ONLY the corrected Bengali translation without any additional text.
